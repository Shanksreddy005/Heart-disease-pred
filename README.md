# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early detection and prevention critical. Data-driven prediction systems can significantly improve diagnosis accuracy and assist in timely intervention. Machine Learning offers powerful tools to build such systems, delivering accurate and scalable predictions.

In this project, I analyzed the UCI Heart Disease Dataset and performed extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis. Multiple machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient health parameters.

Algorithms Implemented:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)

Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine â€“ Linear Kernel (Scikit-learn)

K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)

Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)

Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

XGBoost (Scikit-learn)

Artificial Neural Network â€“ 1 Hidden Layer (Keras)

Key Highlights:

Comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features.

Comparative model evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Achieved 95% accuracy using the Random Forest classifier.

Implemented both traditional ML models and a simple neural network to compare performance.

Developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook (Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras).

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras.
